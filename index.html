        <h3>To become A world class Developer</h3>
        <p>Dreams are necessary. Without dreams, there will be no ambition to chase. There will be no goal to reach. We will all be nothing without dreams. Not having dreams is like chasing a traceless murder. It is like following an invisible shadow. It is a dreadful goose chase. We must know what we want to do and follow that ambition. We canâ€™t achieve anything in life without goals, and for these goals, we need to dream.</p>

       <p>Good web development means a fully optimised website.As human beings, we pride ourselves on our superb adaptation skills and ability to change with the times. Stemming from this, when the social world shifted from a place of interpersonal connections to internet connections, so did the world of business. There's no getting around it; our digitally-driven lifestyle has given us little choice but to adapt to technology, and if you haven't already, it's time to get a move on. </p>

        <h3 class="name-h">2021-Present | As a baby Web developer</h3>
        <p>Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with high-quality images and thought-out presentation will have a large influence on customers, and it is important to strive towards making your product as relatable and appealing as possible.</p>
